1. I have added following methods to AnimationObject which needs to be added to its children objects too.
Add them to StackAnimationObject, LinkedListAnimationObject, TextRectAnimationObject, PointerAnimationObject,
LinkedNodeAnimationObject
    AnimationObject.prototype.setXY = function (x,y) {
    };

    AnimationObject.prototype.getX = function () {
    };

    AnimationObject.prototype.getY = function () {
    };

2. Change the StackAnimationObject to do the animation using unitTime. Also take advantage of AnimUtils

3. in parsing code, ignore the definition statements in for loop declaration and include the statements inside the inner functions
